As a social event we have a special surprise for you! Since a lot of attendees had to suffer from the cold at LKCE16, this year we want to make sure that everyone is warm and cozy!

That’s why we are inviting you to a magical evening at the tropical aquarium at Hamburg’s renowned Zoo „Hagenbeck’s Tierpark“.

Did you ever enjoy a glass of bubbles while watching sharks? Or had dinner at a lodge while crocodiles are floating underneath you? Come and join us this year for dinner & drinks with old and new friends at Hamburg’s famous tropical aquarium!

We would like to thank [Kanbanize](http://kanbanize.com) as our Diamond Sponsor for supporting LKCE’s social event. See you all at the shark reef!
