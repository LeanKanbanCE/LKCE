The gates are open!<br>

You can register now for Lean Kanban Central Europe 2017. As every year we are using an airline price model. This means prices will be raised as we are getting closer to the event. So hurry up and register early!<br>

Do you need some time to get a sign-off from your boss or a PO-number? No problem – just let us know (lkce@it-agile.de) and we’ll freeze the price for you for 14 days.<br>


More details about speakers, the social event will appear in subsequent posts, meantime like us on [Facebook](https://facebook.com/LeanKanbanCE) and follow on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/intent/user?screen_name=LeanKanbanCE) in order not to miss any cool stuff.
