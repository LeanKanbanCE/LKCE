Dieser Erfahrungsbericht befasst sich mit DISCOVERY-Kanban im Online-Marketing und Produkt-Management (SME Hidden-Champion, Groß- & Einzelhandel für Werkzeug, Werkstatt-Ausstattung / Produktionslinien-Bestückung) und datiert auf 2015ff.
    Aufsetz-Punkt war eine WebShop-Einführung (kundenseitige IT-Abt. vollzog SW-Entwicklung auf Basis Standard-SW-Baukasten-System); das IT-Projekt litt unter Schieflage (offiz. GoLive  vollzogen, der eShop generierte aber kaum Umsatz und sah wenig Traffic). Ursache war u. a. eine mangelhafte Such-Funktion (lt. Quick-Assessment von UX-Experten). Nach techn. BugFix und Umstellung der IT-SW-Entwicklung von 'Cargo-Cult Fake-Agile' auf AgileManifesto-konformeres Arbeiten, war klar, dass weitere Engpässe im Online-Marketing (ProductOwner des eShops) in Anforderungs-Selektion und -Vorbereitung bestanden. DISCOVERY-Kanban behob die Engpässe erfolgreich.

    "description": "Self-governance models (e.g. Holacracy, Teal organization, Sociocracy 3.0, …) as well as
    models
    for aligned autonomy(e.g. the 'Spotify model') have emerged to address the need
    for strategic agility.Strategic agility,
    however,
    requires more than autonomy and alignment. Suppose that you are working in an organization where you have multiple initiatives going
    on.On a regular basis work finishes and capacity becomes available(supply - side). At the
    same time customers – external as well as internal– are requesting new work to be
    performed(demand - side). Ideally,
    you can perfectly match the needs of newly arrived work
    with the capacity that has become available.In reality,
    however,
    work arrives when there is
    no free capacity or where the right type of capacity is not free; or,
    capacity becomes
    available when there is no new demand or where the demand is not of the right type.
    Whether we want it or not,
    organizations are market places where an ever - varying,
    ever -
    evolving demand is confronted with an ever varying,
    ever - evolving supply. These market
    places are internal,
    but reflect the external market place.As a reflection they can draw
    inspiration from these external market places in the way they are operated.In this
    presentation we will explore what it takes to run an 'agile portfolio' as an(internal) market
    place inspired on financial markets.
    We will start with laying out the structure of the portfolio as a market place(who trades what, and so on). In analogy to the concept of market liquidity that can be found in financial
    markets,
    we will explore organizational liquidity as a measure of how well supply and
    demand can be matched.We will take into account all the realities of a varying demand and
    a constrained supply and discuss why and how to improve liquidity.We will explore the
    concept of disintermediation(cutting out the middlemen),
    a hot trend in financial markets(e.g.with cryptocurrencies).Inspired by this,
    we will end with giving a glimpse of a possible
    future of internal market places that are regulated by a digicoin.The goal is to explore
    disintermediated liquidity as a powerful new way of self - organizing.

Der Vortrag nennt mögliche Konsequenzen und betont die Notwendigkeit einer ständigen und gleichzeitig ethisch begründeten Suche nach einem immer wieder neuen Mandat für Kanban.

    Starting with Kanban, this quickly developed to a separate agency model: a version of #NoEstimates called #RawEstimates combined with agile and lean methods. A new child was born named RE.A.L.
    It mainly includes 4 key facts: The closely defined goals and three numbers (Number of modules, price and duration). But the radically new concept is, that there is no contract concluded.
    What sounds scary, not only comes with a lot of flexibility but also with more customer satisfaction, cheaper and better projects, no offers and no specifications or duty staplers.
    But surely the customer is one of the most important parts in this equation: Real agility demands an agile customer!
    Gina and Sven will explain how they managed to expand their agile agency world to incorporate the customer truly.

    Even though we had regular replenishment meetings where product managers and business picked things we should do next, it didn’t help much. Managers were constantly fighting with each other,  behind-the-scenes games and manipulations took place from time to time. Decisions were based on how convincing and impressive features’ presentation were or because someone worked out a deal with decision makers. At the same time, our CEO was often dissatisfied with the fact that improvements/features he requested were not implemented.
    On top of that, our development team had a conflict with the product team since PMs blamed developers that they cannot fulfil all their requests, while developers complained that the product team tries to push their features to development, no matter what, bypassing all agreements and processes.

    "description": "Some companies motivate people with perks, ultimately draining motivation. Here’s a scientific explanation & some hands-on options for enabling true motivation.</br>
    This type is called autonomous motivation (AM). It’s the inner engine that enables employees to produce exceptional results, act as intrapreneurs & handle stiff challenges with grace. Research shows, AM shouldn’t be confused with intrinsic motivation or fun.</br>
    High AM results in a reduced operational risk, as it lowers the probability of work-related accidents & decreases the error rate. An increased AM will lead to healthier employees & improve outcome quality. Yet, the most important effect: it enables people to think & work productively in complex contexts.</br>
    I’ll speak about the psychology of motivation & its 3 enablers. True agility, as it is embodied in the agile principles, spurs these 3 enablers. When they’re mishandled, though, highly motivated teams can turn into passive groups of people who don’t mind producing waste.

Yet time is also a key fitness criterion for customers and a key measure of business agility. So, it’s important! The Kanban way is, then, to do something about it.</br>
    We’ve learned lots in recent years about the nature of time it takes to solve a problem and deliver the solution to your customer. The nature of this problem is risk. So, we’ll unhide the risks of delay, such as dependencies, blockage, queuing, rework and pre-emption. And then we’ll reduce, eliminate and mitigate these risks. We’ll prioritize these improvement actions. We’ll balance raw data, knowledge discovery and simulation approaches to improve agility and fitness for purpose.",
