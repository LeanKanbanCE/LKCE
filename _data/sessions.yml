Leider verwenden die meisten Unternehmen Kanban nur dafür, ihre Dysfunktionalität routiniert zu verwalten. Ich will meine Erfahrungen von zahlreichen Kanban-Einführungen teilen und zeigen, worauf es wirklich ankommt, damit man ernsthafte Verbesserungen in einer Organisation erreicht."

  title: "Visual Workmanagement at Sanofi - A Journey towards organizational effectiveness"
  description: "Evolutionary change is one of the core principles of the Kanban method. Today, Sanofis central unit for the development and application of custom-built test methods and equipment for medical devices is using Kanban on higher Flight Levels in addition to local team optimization through Scrum. However, this is just one step in a continuous journey developing from a slow centralized managed organization to a highly flexible unit. By giving insights to his personal experiences as a department leader during the agile transition, Thomas is showing why the department took different steps and iterations explaining the development of their Portfolio Kanban. This process makes sure that the right teams are working on the most valuable product at the right time. It dramatically reduces the lead time of their services and thus supports that medical devices can be brought to market much earlier."

  description: "Portfolio management is a key aspect of organizational performance. The ability to visualize upcoming projects, projects in progress, the process of value creation, the dependencies, the ability to share a common vision and to throttle the work in progress based on organizational capacity are all contributing elements to the effectiveness of an organization.</br>Unfortunately, the shared vision of a portfolio is too often buried in a tool shared with too few people and does not help the organization build a global and cohesive plan of action.</br>
  Create alignment around what delivers value to your end-users, use cadence to move forward, help shape a new organizational culture, support innovation, continuous improvement, and leadership and unite people around a shared mission, that is what Kanban at the strategic level can bring."

For ages this has been one of the first questions customers have.</br></br>Over time we have stepped away from traditional planning as it was unreliable and left behind estimation poker as it was not good enough. In Kanban systems, probabilistic forecasting turned out to be a good approach -- yet there are still open questions.</br></br>What if there are multiple points where work can enter (or leave) the system or if work may also flow backwards?
  Are there ways to do reliable forecasting in such a system? The power of maths may offer a way and in this talk you can learn how it works."

  title: "SMART Option Picking for DISCOVERY Kanban – how to pull the right items for evaluation"
  description: "Digital market transformation forces organizations to cope with challenges in SMART-picking of future
  options from idea-pools in a CUSTOMER-Kanban environment. In order to stay fit-for-purpose (F4P)
  appropriate services need a market-fitting design, implementation, and service-delivery meeting
  expectation-levels set by customers and other stakeholders. In VUCA-environments often getting to the
  right choice proves demanding not only to Service Request Managers, but also for seasoned Sr. Leaders on
  C-level.</br></br>
  The technique referred to in this session was developed in recent years and evolutionary adjusted to fit
  various business contexts ranging from turn-around situations, wide-range applicability in high-tech SW-
  development, and also including XXL-scale programs for SW-implementation &amp; roll-out.
  Its major contribution is an agnostic approach to addressing VUCA-characteristics in option-pools thereby
  allowing effective pick &amp; structured processing of items to be pulled into DISCOVERY-procedures (which
  sometimes already impose major capacity-commit on knowledgable individuals running the evaluations) –
  the method massively leverages visualization techniques and therefore nicely fits Kanban-principles."

  title: "Keynote: Intent-Based Leadership: Create Leaders at Every Level​"
  description: "David Marquet delivers the powerful Intent-Based Leadership Message:  that leadership is not for the select few at the top.  In highly effective organizations, there are leaders at every level.</br></br>
  Creating Intent-Based Leadership organizations results in a workplace where everyone engages and contributes their full intellectual capacity.  A place where people are healthier and happier because they have more control over their work - a place where everyone is a leader.</br></br>
  Intent-Based Leadership organizations create an environment for people to contribute so that they feel valued.  They set clear goals so their people know how to do their jobs.  They push control and decision making down the organization so people take responsibility and rise to the occassion.  They maintain unity of effort by ensuring the supporting pillars of technical competence and organizational clarity are in place.</br></br>
  As a result they achieve:
  <ul>
    <li>A highly effective organization with superior morale</li>
    <li>The capacity for greatness in the people and practices of an organization, and remove it from the personality of leaders</li>
    <li>An organizational culture that creates additional leaders throughout every level of the organization</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Intent-Based Leadership starts with rejecting the idea that leadership is for the select few at the top and instead embracing in highly effective organizations, there are leaders at every level. This method of leadership is based on empowerment, not ego, and process, not personality.</p>"

In this presentation I will share my last 4 years of experience with Toyota Kata and especially the job of scaling it across all layers of a 700 people IT organization. How does it translate to a context where the flow of value is counted in days and not seconds? Where did we fail, what adaptions were made, what results did we achieve and why is it both more powerful and more difficult than any of us believed?"

  title: "The Power of a Lean Kanban Workflow for Marketing Teams"
  description: "What do the processes of developing software and launching a marketing campaign have in common? Everything except the final product. Widely, development and marketing teams have more occasion to collaborate. The result has been discovering how similar are the challenges they face in their daily work. Using the same tools, such as Lean and Agile methodologies, to tackle these shared process hurdles is the natural next step for symbiosis between these two departments. But...where to begin?</br></br>
  Applying Lean & Agile in the marketing context is an experiment in creating a more efficient, streamlined workflow than a creative team may be used to. As the head of a marketing team, supporting the shipping of a SaaS product, I became accustomed to trying out methods I saw our developers use on my own team. After over two years running my marketing team on Kanban, I can attest to the fact that adopting a flow-based method that aims to deliver maximum value to the customer has the potential to transform the marketing game at scale. Recently, I have been collecting case studies from industry leaders who are also implementing Lean and Kanban in their marketing departments. I will share some of their learnings with you.</br></br>
  This talk will centre on how Lean Kanban principles and practices can move beyond development and production, in order to boost collaboration, communication and transparency in any marketing team."

  title: "KMM Cultural Appraisal and Practical Guidance for Leaders"
  description: "The Kanban Maturity Model levels are defined by the outcomes an organization consistently achieves, by the sophistication of the general practices we recommend, and by the nature of the culture - defined by the values people hold.</br></br>
  This talk will explain how the KMM approach to culture appraisal avoids the bias of self-reporting, and using invalid instruments for measurement, by instead relying on four types of evidence the appraiser finds that supports or contradicts if a value is strongly held.</br></br>
  People need to hold these values strongly - to believe these things matter - or they will be unwilling to implement changes or abandon disciplines that got them improved results.</br></br>
  Therefore, this talk will also explain the approach to providing practical guidance for leaders (and coaches) to drive the adoption of the values that increase the willingness to evolve the implementation of the specific practices as a means to get improved results."

  description: "How does Kanban handle risk and recovery in global disaster relief and business continuity?</br></br>
  The definition of disaster is a condition in which demand far exceeds capacity to cope. Reports of relief efforts after disasters such as earthquakes and tsunamis show lack of coordination, overwhelmed relief workers, and problems with transporting supplies. Before a disaster, preparation means looking at dimensions of risk reduction: vulnerability, efficiency, resilience, system fragility, and the policies of a recovery plan.</br></br>
  Kanban is uniquely well-suited to manage conditions of unbalanced demand vs capacity. This talk looks at the way elements of Kanban can help your business before and after a market disaster, as well as improve serious disaster relief worldwide."

  title: "Keynote: Evolving Fit-for-Purpose Organizations using the Kanban Maturity Model"
  description: "There are two recognized failure modes in Kanban implementations: aborted start - the kanban system design was too ambitious; false summit plateau - a failure to aspire to effective business outcomes, and, or, a failure to create just enough stress to catalyze further changes. Business are subject to evolutionary forces in the marketplace: only the fittest survive and thrive. Kanban provides the mechanism to drive evolutionary change and enure the survival of fit-for-purpose products and services. The main and first purpose of the Kanban Maturity Model is to guide appropriate implementation to avoid both failure modes. The secondary purpose is to provide a roadmap to guide further improvements whilst continuing to avoid both failure modes. The results should enable steady improvement towards fit-for-purpose products and services, and a fit-for-purpose, sustainable, thriving organization with satisfied customers and reliable, predictable economic results. Appropriate use of the Kanban Maturity Model increases the probability of a successful outcome."
