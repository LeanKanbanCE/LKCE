  bio: "'The Responsibility Process guy' is a reformed management consultant. After a decade helping corporations help smart, ambitious professionals find ways to cope with lives they don't want and think they can't change, Christopher realized coping skills are overrated. A better skill is knowing how to apply your innate leadership ability to face and overcome any challenge.</br></br>
  That's freeing.</br></br>
  Today he supports leaders and leadership teams in generating newfound freedom, choice, and power for themselves and others. How? By advancing the world's first proven how-to approach for understanding, teaching, and taking personal responsibility.</br></br>
  Christopher is the CEO of Partnerwerks, Inc., the leadership development firm. Wondering why so many smart people spend unhappy lives at work, he left a perfectly good job in his mid-twenties to return to school and earn a Ph.D. in organization science from the University of Texas at Austin."
